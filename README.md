# Reimagined Animal Crossing Loading Screen

## Overview

This project explores the design of video game loading screens, focusing on enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. The project involved collecting and analyzing data on various loading screens across popular video games to understand their impact on the user experience. Based on the insights gathered, I designed and developed a prototype for a reimagined loading screen for *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*.

## Background

Loading screens are an integral part of the user experience in video games. While they are often seen as a necessary pause, they can be designed to enhance immersion and provide additional value to players. This project aims to reimagine the loading screen for *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* by making it more engaging and informative, based on insights from a research study on user interaction with loading screens in various video games.

## Research Process

1. **Data Collection**: Conducted surveys and usability testing to gather information on user preferences and pain points regarding video game loading screens.
2. **Analysis**: Analyzed data to identify common themes and user expectations.
3. **Insight Generation**: Derived key insights about what makes a loading screen engaging and immersive.
4. **Design Iteration**: Based on the insights, a new prototype was designed for the *Animal Crossing* loading screen.

## Design Goals

- **Engagement**: Create a loading screen that keeps players engaged during wait times.
- **Immersion**: Enhance the thematic elements of *Animal Crossing* to maintain immersion.
- **Informative Content**: Provide useful tips and game-related information during the loading screen.

## Prototype

The prototype for the reimagined loading screen introduces the following features:

- **Animated Background**: A repeating animation that reflects the game's theme.
- **Interactive Tips**: Game tips displayed interactively, allowing users to cycle through them.
- **Immersive Design**: Visual elements that are consistent with the *Animal Crossing* art style.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For designing wireframes and prototypes.
- **React**: For building the interactive prototype.
- **Spline**: For creating 3D animations and models.

## Setup Instructions
